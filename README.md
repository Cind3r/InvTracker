# Why use this tool?

Around 30%-40% of time spent working as a clerk within a store is sifting through ordered items and comparing to what needs to be restocked. Employees improperly concatenating backstock, providing no visual indication of the stored product, and limited space to bring the product onto the floor all affect job effeciency. 

This bottleneck can be reduced by providing clear information, but hands-on approaches like labeling or listing take time as well. This is a solution that uses a common device and provides information on how work is being processed on the floor as well. 

By showing time differentials on when items were checked, we can provide insightful information on what needs to be restocked. Creating a visual list of items that need to be culled from a department also ensures safety for consumers and eases restocking by removing excess floor items before the processes begins.
